# AnomalyDetection-Netflow-UNSW-NB15
These two notebooks are a part of my master thesis which was to use feature selection techniques on a labelled netflow-based dataset in order to detect anomalies within a network dataset.

**NOTE** 
This code runs on a small subset (24347 rows) of full dataset (1.6 million rows). The full dataset is available and can be found online.

**Notebook 1: Cleaning data** 
This notebook was simply the initial cleaning the data

**Notebook 2: Preparation and modeling** 
This notebook prepares the dataset by splitting it as well as preprocessing the features separately. Lastly feature selection methods are used and several modeling techniques are applied.
